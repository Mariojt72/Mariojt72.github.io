## 🧠 About Me
I am a **PhD candidate in Artificial Intelligence** focused on computer vision, multimodal learning, generative models, 3D shape analysis, and end-to-end deep learning systems.  
My research explores the use of **Optimal Transport** to improve generative models and the analysis of human body shape evolution.

I work on multimodal pipelines, 3D body modeling, and explainable generative AI, contributing to scientific publications and collaborative research projects.
